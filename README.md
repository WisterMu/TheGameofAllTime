For the Game of All Time. IDK if I set this up right...

Alright so if you're reading this you found yourself at the repository, which is good

How to edit the repository: 
1. Clone the repo
    - You should probably download github desktop and clone it there (nice easy button presses)
    - This creates a folder which is a copy of the repo on your system
2. Make changes
    - Should be a simple as editing the files in the repo, changes are tracked automatically
3. Commit changes
    - Name it something helpful
    - Basically just packaging the changes underneath a label, you can make multiple commits if you want
4. Push commit
    - This is what confirms the actual changes into the branch
