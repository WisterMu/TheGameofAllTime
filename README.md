# TheGameofAllTime
For the Game of All Time. IDK if I set this up right...

Alright so if you're reading this you found yourself at the repository, which is good

How to edit the repository: 
1. Clone the repo
    - You should probably download github desktop and clone it there (nice easy button presses)
    - Should look like this once done

        - REMEMBER TO **FETCH ORIGIN** BEFORE MAKING CHANGES, this updates any new changes from the original into your copy
        - If you don't do this, you risk causing conflicts (not good)
    - This creates a folder which is a copy of the repo on your system
    - *(technically speaking you can do all your editing and coding on the website itself but I don't think that's a good idea)*
2. Make changes
    - Should be a simple as editing the files in the repo, changes are tracked automatically
3. Commit changes
    - Name it something helpful
    - Basically just packaging the changes underneath a label, you can make multiple commits if you want
4. Push commit
    - This is what confirms the actual changes into the branch

    - If you messed up a commit, make sure you undo and fix it BEFORE you push
