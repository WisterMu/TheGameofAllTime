Upon arriving to Dianthos, the party approaches a church.

Mike: What about that chapel-looking building over there? It's probably got a graveyard out back that we can, uh, put Socks to rest in.

Torin: That’s not a bad idea. Though, Gloves, I must ask if you have a preferred rite we carry out, since you are- ah, were Sock’s family… You two are related, right?

Gloves: Mhm. Socks was like a brother to me… or maybe a cousin, no, aunt…

Ione: Let’s just get going. Look! A priest is tending to the chapel, I’m sure he can help us find a solution to our… situation. Sir!
